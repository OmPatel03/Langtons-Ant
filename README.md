# Langtons-Ant
A simulation of the cellular automata known as "Langton's Ant".

### Rules

* At a white square, turn 90° clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.

* At a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

___The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) contains further information on this simulation.___



### Features

* The slider controls the speed at which the simulation runs
* The reset button resets the simulation by placing the ant in the middle of the grid and turning all the squares white
